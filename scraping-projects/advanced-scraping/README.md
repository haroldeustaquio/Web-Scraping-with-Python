# Advanced Scraping

Welcome to the **Advanced Scraping** section of this repository. This section contains projects that tackle the most complex web scraping challenges, including scraping JavaScript-heavy sites, handling anti-bot mechanisms, and working with APIs that require advanced techniques. The goal is to refine your skills and enable you to scrape data from sophisticated web applications.

## ðŸš€ Tools and Libraries

In this section, I will utilize the following advanced tools:

1. **`Selenium`** or **`Playwright`**: 
   - Powerful tools for automating browsers, capable of handling JavaScript-heavy websites and user interactions.
   - [Selenium Documentation](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/)
   - [Playwright Documentation](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro)

2. **`Scrapy`**: 
   - A fast and powerful web scraping framework. In this section, we will explore more advanced features such as item pipelines and middlewares.
   - [Documentation](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/)

3. **Proxy Services**: 
   - Services that allow you to route your scraping requests through multiple IP addresses to avoid detection and bans.
   - [Documentation on rotating proxies](https://www.scrapingbee.com/blog/rotating-proxies/)

4. **Captcha Solvers** (optional): 
   - Tools that can help bypass CAPTCHA challenges when scraping certain websites.
   - [Documentation on CAPTCHA solving](https://www.2captcha.com/)

These tools are essential for overcoming the challenges posed by modern web applications.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

This directory contains the following projects:

### 1. JavaScript Heavy Site Scraper
- **Goal**: Learn to scrape data from websites that rely heavily on JavaScript for rendering content.
- **Tools Used**: `Selenium` or `Playwright`, `BeautifulSoup`, `pandas`.
- **Project Path**: `/advanced-scraping/project-javascript-heavy/`

### 2. Anti-Bot Detection Scraper
- **Goal**: Learn techniques to scrape data from websites with strong anti-bot detection mechanisms.
- **Tools Used**: `Scrapy`, `Selenium`, Proxy services, CAPTCHA solvers.
- **Project Path**: `/advanced-scraping/project-anti-bot-detection/`

Each project has its own directory with a detailed README explaining how the scraper works and how to run the code.
