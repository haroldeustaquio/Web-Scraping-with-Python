# GitHub Scraper

## Project Description

This project consists of a **web scraper** that extracts user information and repository details from a GitHub profile page. The goal is to capture the **full name**, **description** of the user, and repository data such as **name**, **URL**, **description**, **programming language**, **stars**, **forks**, **license**, and **last update**.

This scraper is designed as a basic web scraping project using:
- *Pandas*
- *NumPy*
- *Selenium*
- *WebDriver*

## Project Structure

- `scraper.ipynb`: The main scraper file, which contains the code to extract data.
- `user_info.csv`: The processed user data obtained from the GitHub profile.
- `repos_info.csv`: The processed repository data obtained from the profile.
- `README.md`: This file explains how the project works and how to use it.

## Challenges Faced

During the development of this web scraper, several challenges were encountered:

- **Handling Page Failures**: Occasionally, pages would not load properly or time out. To handle this, the script includes error-handling mechanisms to continue execution even if a page fails. Selenium's `WebDriverWait` was used to manage page loads and ensure that key elements were present before attempting data extraction.

- **Incomplete Data**: Not all repositories contained the same metadata (e.g., some lacked descriptions, stars, or licenses). A robust error-handling strategy was implemented using `try-except` blocks to assign `NaN` values to any missing information. This ensured that the scraping process could continue without halting due to incomplete data.
